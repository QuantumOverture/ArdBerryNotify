Raspberry PI:

* TextBlob + Important messagers list => Classify emails
* Get weather data as well
* Python Script sets up serial connection between Arduino and feeds data into it.
* Connects to LCD for more info.
    * Tells you what is wrong in banner style(NYSE style).


***
Arduino:

* Turns on lights:
    * RBG for messages.
    * RGB for environment status.
      * LCD for more info.
    * Tells you what is wrong in banner style(NYSE style).
    * Red light for classes.

***
V2 Idea:

* Use Rapberry PI Zero w + Arduino or TI BreadBoard Booster -> Only focus on the environmental status but also make a physical housing for it and add things like apparent temperature calculations.
